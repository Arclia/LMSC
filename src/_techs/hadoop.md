If you're new to Hadoop, then you probably think that it's just some kind of database application that you can install and run.

It isn't.

Hadoop is really an entire ecosystem of services, filesystems, job schedulers, and more.  So, before you even attempt to install things locally, you should probably just run a pre-made sandbox.
